<h2>About me</h2>
<p><strong>I teach the teachers.</strong> I work in higher ed IT where I train faculty in best ways to use tech in course design.</p>
<p>The work involves running trainings, producing instructional media, building blended courses and supporting their use of elearning applications. I also do learning experience analytics, user experience testing, knowledge management and web development. That's my 9 to 5...</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on my 5 to 9, I'm the teacher. I lead evening grad courses on computational skills, introducing journalism students to computer science and data science. I teach them how to use data analysis in their reporting and produce interactive visualizations for the web.</p>
